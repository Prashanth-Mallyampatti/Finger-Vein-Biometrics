# Finger-Vein-Biometrics

Finger Vein Biometrics using Machine Learning

MATLAB application which analyzes the Person's finger vein data using Machine Learning algorithms.

  > Finger Vein Biometrics is one of the most advanced authentication systems, which solves many problems of existing authentication systems.
  
  > SVM(with linear, RBF, MLP, Quadratic, and polynomial kernels), Random Forests, Decision Tree, Linear & Logistic   Regression, K-Means, DB-Scan, Nearest neighbor, K-Nearest Neighbor were some of the algorithms used to train and test the data set.
  
  > Used CCD scanned image data. These images were Pre-Processed, filtered and the resulting data was used.
  
  > 2D plotted graphs showing the results of classification and the accuracies.
  
  > The source code has static file paths which may subject to errors if not handled properly.
